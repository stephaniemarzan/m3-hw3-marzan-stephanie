Assignment 3

## Responsive Navigation Bar
I used the Bootstrap guide in order to implement a responsive navigation bar with a hamburger menu. I ran into issues because the hamburger menu would not toggle open so I asked the professor for assistance. The issue was related to the version of Javascript being used and my CSS overriding the Bootstrap CSS.

## HTML Validator
I used an HTML Validator to check my html and found a few issues that I then fixed. 

## Link Colors
I wanted to change the light color scheme that the bootstrap code had on links so I used "!important" to prioritize my font color over the default set by Bootstrap.

## Nesting
I ran into issues with nesting because I was trying to achieve a very specific hierarchy in order to make some text spans a different color. I did regular nesting and it did not work. I found a solution in Stack Overflow that suggested placing an ampersand before the class name. Luckily, that worked.

## Bootstrap Grid
I used the bootstrap guide in order to create a 12-column layout and align items inside the columns.

## Header Image
I was using positioning to achieve the desired look but after speaking to the professor realized that it would be best to make the header image a background image of the section and then use opacity and an overlay to only affect the color of the image and not the content above it.
